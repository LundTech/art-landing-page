# Art Landing Page demo
Lightweight and responsive landing page written in React and themed for opening of an art gallery.
The project is a proof of concept in using CSS and Flexbox to build a full-screen background image with overlay text and keeping it responsive for both desktop and mobile users.

Additionally, pressing the "Sign up" button opens up a modal with a smooth fade-in and fade-out effect.

## Running the project
```
yarn
yarn start
```
